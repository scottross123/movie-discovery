# milestone3-sross47

Movie Discovery Web App

React, HTML, and CSS used for frontend, Python framework Flask used for backend, Flask-SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL used for database. Project deployed and database hosted on Heroku. TMDB and Wikipedia APIs used to get information on movies.

Secret key and database key needed.

To start project make sure to run npm install, npm run build, npm start, and python3 app.py

1) The first technical issue I had was using the fetch API. The syntax for making fetch calls confused me at first and I wasn't sure what headers to include or how .then works. I was able to fix my issues by studying the fetch documentation and looking at some tutorials on youtube.

2) The second technical issue was connectnig the React frontend to the Flask backend. I was really confused at first how to get it to work and how to use flask routes as endpoints. I was able to fix this by watching the indiviual project walkthrough and looking at the code for my group project.

3) The third technical issue was linking my react component to my HTML tempalates. I was able to do this using Flask blueprints and setting a new template folder for the react portion of the app.

The hardest part of this project was milestone 3 and connecting frontend to backend. I would a;so say that and using React was the most useful part of the project though. I really see the benefit in using React as a frontend for a web app now and glad it is now apart of my skillset.
